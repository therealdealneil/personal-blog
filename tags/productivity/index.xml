This let you remove emails from your inbox, yet not completely delete them in case you needed to retrieve an email at a later time. Frequently, you archive an email without even opening it when the subject tells you all you need to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, this means you end up with unread emails in your archive. Gmail doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a feature to mark as read and archive in one fail swoop. However, there is a clever trick to help automate this process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Make VS Code Smarter with GitLens!</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-gitlens-to-boost-productivity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-gitlens-to-boost-productivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the realm of software development, understanding the history of your codebase is paramount.

&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, managing passwords can be a daunting task. With the increasing number of online accounts, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to maintain strong, unique passwords for each one. Yet, many people avoid using password managers for no good reason, often relying on weak, easily guessable passwords or reusing the same password across multiple sites. This practice is a recipe for disaster, leading to potential identity theft and account breaches. Amongst the alternatives, I recommend most people adopt &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden&lt;/a> as their password manager of choice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost Browser Productivity with CrxMouse for Chrome</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-crxmouse-gestures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-crxmouse-gestures/</guid><description>&lt;p>\&lt;/p>
