&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, managing passwords can be a daunting task. With the increasing number of online accounts, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to maintain strong, unique passwords for each one. Yet, many people avoid using password managers for no good reason, often relying on weak, easily guessable passwords or reusing the same password across multiple sites. This practice is a recipe for disaster, leading to potential identity theft and account breaches. Amongst the alternatives, I recommend most people adopt &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden&lt;/a> as their password manager of choice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost Browser Productivity with CrxMouse for Chrome</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-crxmouse-gestures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-crxmouse-gestures/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced development environment, ensuring the stability and reliability of your applications is paramount. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through &lt;strong>exception monitoring&lt;/strong>. This practice not only helps in identifying and resolving issues quickly but also enhances the overall quality and user experience of your software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my early engineering career, I used email to capture exceptions from our applications. Obviously, it became overwhelming and inefficient quickly! After some time, I adopted dedicated monitoring tools like &lt;a href="https://sentry.io/">&lt;strong>Sentry&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> which brought immediate and significant productivity benefits for myself and my teams. The benefits of these tools may not initially be obvious, but once it&amp;rsquo;s adopted across an organization, it reduces many inefficiencies that team members weren&amp;rsquo;t even aware of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get Grubhub+ With Amazon Prime!</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/get-grubhub-with-amazon-prime/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/get-grubhub-with-amazon-prime/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

&lt;p>During my recent state vehicle inspection, they flagged my windshield wipers as needing replacement. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass my inspection until I provided proof that it was replaced, or let them replace it. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a common tactic to make easy money. Windshield wipers are ridiculously easy to replace and you should always do it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing holding me back in the past was the cost. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify replacing windshield wipers every year when they ran up to $30 for a pair. Or pay less for a budget pair which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long to start streaking on your windshields.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Securing ASP .NET Core Apps Made Easy</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/secure-headers-asp-net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 09:32:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/secure-headers-asp-net/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;p>Whether you like it or not, there are best practices for security that web applications need to follow. 👋 Today, I want to chat about a nifty little library that can make your ASP.NET Core applications more secure with minimal effort.

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been working with web applications for a while, you know that security is a big deal. One common way to enhance security is by adding security headers to your HTTP responses. These headers can help protect against a variety of attacks, like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. However, manually configuring these headers can be a bit of a hassle. You have to remember which headers to add, what values to set, and ensure they&amp;rsquo;re applied consistently across your app.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Home Repairs Easily with Google Sheets</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/track-home-repairs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 12:01:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/track-home-repairs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
