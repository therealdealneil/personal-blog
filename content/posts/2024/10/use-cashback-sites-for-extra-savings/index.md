In today's world, who doesn't love a good deal? With online shopping becoming more ubiquitous, the quest for savings is more relevant than ever. Previously, I discussed how you can find easy coupon codes with [RetailMeNot](/posts/2024/10/use-retailmenot-to-save-big). But one of the most effective ways to save money while shopping online is through cashback sites like Rakuten. If you're not familiar with how these platforms work, buckle up. You’re about to find out how you can make every purchase count and put some cash back into your pocket.

### How Cashback Sites Work

Cashback websites partner with thousands of online retailers, from major giants to niche boutiques, to offer a percentage of your purchase back in the form of cash. Essentially, when you shop through these sites, they earn a commission from the retailer, and then share a portion of that commission with you. It's a win-win situation—you get your favorite products, and some extra cash back.

### Why Rakuten?

[Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/) used to go by the name eBates (which was a much better name, in my opinion!). It's one of the most well-known and user-friendly cashback sites out there. It boasts partnerships with over 2,500 stores, including big names like Amazon, Walmart, and Macy's. The cashback percentages vary depending on the retailer and current promotions, but you can often find deals ranging from 1% to 10%, and occasionally even higher.

### Easy Installation with Browser Extensions

One of the best features of Rakuten is its [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rakuten-get-cash-back-for/chhjbpecpncaggjpdakmflnfcopglcmi), which makes enabling cashback as easy as clicking a button. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. **Install the Extension**: Head to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/) (or your browser’s equivalent) and search for the Rakuten extension. It’s free to install.
2. **Activate Cashback**: Once installed, the extension will notify you whenever you visit a partner store, prompting you to activate cashback. No need to remember to visit Rakuten's site before shopping.
3. **Shop as Usual**: With the cashback activated, just shop as you normally would. Rakuten tracks your purchase and credits your account with the cashback percentage.
4. **Get Paid**: Rakuten sends out payments every quarter via PayPal or check, as long as you’ve accumulated $5.01 or more in cashback.

### Why You Should Use Rakuten

Not only is Rakuten incredibly easy to use, but it also offers a plethora of additional features to enhance your shopping experience:

- **Coupons and Promo Codes**: Rakuten often has exclusive coupons and promo codes that you can stack on top of cashback offers, maximizing your savings.
- **Cashback on Travel**: Beyond everyday shopping, Rakuten also offers cashback on travel bookings, including flights, hotels, and car rentals.
- **Double Cashback Events**: Periodically, Rakuten runs special promotions where cashback rates are doubled at select stores. Keep an eye out for these events to boost your savings even further.
