There are a few times in my life where I was blown away by a piece of technology. My first robot vacuum purchase in 2017 was one of those. At that time, I decided to take a deep dive into robot vacuums. After many years of hearing about them, I felt the time was right and smarts in the technology were ready for wide adoption. After pouring into my research, I purchased a Xiaomi Mi Vacuum. This was an international Chinese vacuum which made me a little hesitant, but the buzz behind it was incredible. Turned out, it was well deserved.

The robot would start up and immediately start mapping out my home. It would then systematically start running itself across every nook and cranny of my home. Once done, it would park itself back into its charging dock. To top it off, the app would show a map of your home with tracks indicating exactly where the robot went.

Each day at it's scheduled time, it went about its business scooping up all kinds of dust, crumbs and more from my floors. With two toddlers in house, you can imagine how invaluable this was. What amazed me most was how reliable it was and how smart its technology was. Unlike vacuums from years earlier, this one was systematic and would map out your home and ensure maximum coverage. Other vacuums would just go around randomly and you'd get lucky if it actually covered your floors.

Fast-forward to today and the company behind my Xiaomi Mi vacuum decided to enter the global market under the [Roborock](https://us.roborock.com/) brand. I purchased a newer model in 2022 and it continues to dazzle me. I strongly recommend these vacuums for everyone.
