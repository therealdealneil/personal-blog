Letâ€™s be honest â€“ filling up your gas tank isnâ€™t exactly the highlight of your week. But what if I told you thereâ€™s a way to make this routine expense a little more rewarding? Enter [**Upside**](https://www.upside.com/), an app that turns your everyday gas purchases into easy cashback. I'm a huge fan of using [cashback sites](/posts/2024/10/use-cashback-sites-for-extra-savings) to get money back for purchases you were already going to make. Why not do the same thing with your gas purchases!

### The Genius of Getting Cashback on Gas

We all need to fill up our cars regularly. Itâ€™s a non-negotiable expense for most of us. Thatâ€™s why using an app like [Upside](https://www.upside.com/) to get cashback on gas is such a no-brainer. You're already buying gas, so why not get a little something back for it?

### How Upside Works

Upside partners with gas stations, restaurants, and grocery stores to offer cashback on purchases. Hereâ€™s how you can take advantage of it:

1. **Download the Upside App**: Available on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/upside-cash-back-gas-food/id1099997174) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.upside.consumer.android), the app is easy to install and set up.
2. **Find Offers Near You**: Open the app and search for gas stations near you that offer cashback through Upside.
3. **Claim an Offer**: Once you find an offer you like, claim it in the app and choose the credit card you will use.
4. **Fill Up Your Tank**: Head to the gas station, fill up your tank, and pay as usual.

### Why Upside Makes Sense

1. **Easy Savings**: Youâ€™re already buying gas, so this is an effortless way to save a few bucks each month. Those savings add up!
2. **No Extra Work**: Thereâ€™s no need for complicated coupon codes or loyalty programs. Just use the app and get your cashback.
3. **More Than Just Gas**: Upside isnâ€™t limited to gas stations. You can also use it to earn cashback on groceries and dining out.
4. **Stack Your Savings**: Use Upside in conjunction with other rewards programs or credit card perks to maximize your savings.

### Real-Life Savings

Letâ€™s do some quick math. If you fill up your gas tank once a week and spend about $50 each time, earning 3% cashback through Upside would give you $1.50 back per fill-up. Thatâ€™s $6 a month and $72 a year â€“ just for using an app to do something youâ€™re already doing! But be realistic with expectations - these aren't dramatic savings, but a little bit here and there always helps!

### Conclusion

Upside is a straightforward and rewarding way to get cashback on your gas purchases. It requires minimal effort and delivers tangible savings on something you already spend money on. So next time you head to the pump, why not make those dollars work a bit harder for you?

Keep in mind that Upside makes its money by partnering with certain gas stations to offer the cashback. While the cashback is tempting, be practical. Don't go to a gas station farther away just to save a few cents. Don't go to a gas station that actually has a higher price to get the cashback. Use it where it makes sense.
