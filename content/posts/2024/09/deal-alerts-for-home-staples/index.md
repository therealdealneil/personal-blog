In today's fast-paced world, finding the best deals on everyday home staples can be a game-changer for your budget. [Slickdeals](https://www.slickdeals.net), a popular deal-sharing community, offers a powerful feature called [Deal Alerts](https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/) that can help you snag great discounts on items you use regularly. Here's how practical it is to create these alerts and maximize your savings.

### What is Slickdeals?

[Slickdeals](https://www.slickdeals.net) is a deal-sharing community. If there's a deal on any product from any store out there, this community will find it and post to their forums. There's an upvoting feature to vote on the hottest deals. The best of the best become Frontpage deals that show on the landing page. I've been using Slickdeals for over 15 years and it's a core part of my internet experience!

### Why Use Slickdeals Deal Alerts?

[Creating Deal Alerts](https://daily.slickdeals.net/tech/save-time-money-deal-alert/) on Slickdeals is a practical way to ensure you never miss out on discounts for the products you need. Whether it's cleaning supplies, pantry essentials, or household items, Deal Alerts can help you stay on top of the best deals without constantly scouring the internet.

I find it particularly valuable for household staples like toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, and more. These are items you know you need, so why not get an alert whenever there's a deal on it. Most of the deals will be on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com), making it easy to order straight from your phone.

### Setting Up Deal Alerts

Setting up Deal Alerts on Slickdeals is straightforward:

1. **Open Deal Alerts**: From the Slickdeals homepage, click the [Deal Alerts](https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/) link from the top navigation menu.
2. **Create the Alert**: Scroll down to the *Add a Custom Deal Alert* section.
3. **Enter Search Keywords**: Enter keywords you want to trigger an alert.
4. **Expand More Options**: Click *More Options* and enter your notification preferences and frequency. For *Target Forum*, I suggest using *Hot Deals*. For *Rating*, I suggest *+4* so that you're alerted to high rated deals just before they go Frontpage. Once a deal goes Frontpage, there's a likelihood of it expiring quickly.
5. **Submit Alert**: Click the *Add Alert* button to create your alert!

### Practical Tips for Effective Alerts

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your keywords, the better your chances of getting relevant alerts. For example, instead of just "paper towels," try "Bounty paper towels." However, if you keep your search flexible, you increase your chance to get better deals.
2. **Set Multiple Alerts**: If you have several brands or types of products you prefer, set up multiple alerts to cover all your bases.
3. **Adjust Frequency**: You can adjust how often you receive notifications to avoid being overwhelmed by too many alerts.
4. **Read the Forums**: Be sure to skim the forum posts on the deal to ensure there's no caveats or limitations you need to be aware of.

### Conclusion

While household staples aren't normally budget breakers, saving a few dollars here and there adds up over time. With Deal Alerts, there's little to no effort involved. Stay flexible on your brands and you can save even more. Give it a try!
