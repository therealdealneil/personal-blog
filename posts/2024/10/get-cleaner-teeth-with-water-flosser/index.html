While traditional floss has been a staple in dental care for decades, water flossers are gaining popularity as a modern alternative. A few years ago I made a switch to water flossers and I was genuinely surprised at much it improved my teeth. I don&rsquo;t say that in jest either. My dental cleaning appointments became much faster and I noticed less time spent cleaning out plaque and tartar. The hygenists also noticed an improvement in my teeth and commented on how clean they are.</p><p>I highly recommend you give water flossers a shot and here&rsquo;s a dive into why you might consider making the switch.</p><h3 id=effectiveness>Effectiveness</h3><p>Water flossers can remove more plaque and food particles from between your teeth and along the gumline compared to traditional floss. The high-pressure water jets can reach into tight spaces and clean areas that string floss might miss, providing a more thorough cleaning.</p><h3 id=gentle-on-gums>Gentle on Gums</h3><p>For those with sensitive gums or people who experience bleeding during traditional flossing, water flossers offer a gentler alternative. The gentle stream of water can be adjusted in pressure, making it a more comfortable experience without sacrificing effectiveness.</p><h3 id=ease-of-use>Ease of Use</h3><p>Let’s face it: flossing with string can be a hassle. It requires manual dexterity and can be awkward, especially for reaching the back teeth. Water flossers are generally easier to use, making the process quicker and more straightforward, especially for individuals with limited mobility in their hands.</p><h3 id=orthodontic-and-dental-appliance-friendly>Orthodontic and Dental Appliance Friendly</h3><p>Water flossers are particularly beneficial for those with braces, dental implants, or other dental appliances. They can clean around brackets and wires more effectively than traditional floss, which can get caught or be difficult to maneuver around such obstacles.</p><h3 id=deeper-clean>Deeper Clean</h3><p>Water flossers provide a deeper clean by reaching areas that traditional floss might miss. The pulsating water can effectively flush out debris and bacteria from periodontal pockets, which is crucial for preventing gum disease.</p><h3 id=no-sharp-edges>No Sharp Edges</h3><p>Unlike traditional floss, water flossers won&rsquo;t catch on sharp edges or get stuck between tightly spaced teeth. This makes the experience smoother and more enjoyable, reducing the frustration that can sometimes come with traditional flossing.</p><h3 id=recommended-brand>Recommended Brand</h3><p>I personally use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXY19XD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1">Waterpik Aquarius</a> water flosser. <a href=https://www.waterpik.com/>Waterpik</a> is a reputable brand and started the water flosser trend. This is a very popular model for this brand. With that being said, it is also pricey and I recommend <a href=/posts/2024/09/deal-alerts-for-home-staples>waiting for a deal to come around</a>. Or look at alternative brands or models, you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with any brand as they all work very similarly.</p><p><a href=https://www.waterpik.com/products/dental-water-flosser/WP-660/><figure><img src=/posts/2024/10/get-cleaner-teeth-with-water-flosser/aquarius-water-flosser_hu_aea794dd94fba811.jpg alt="Someone using the Aquarius Water Flosser" loading=lazy><figcaption>Image courtesy of Waterpik: https://www.waterpik.com/products/dental-water-flosser/WP-660/</figcaption></figure></a></p><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>While both traditional floss and water flossers have their own merits, the benefits of water flossers are making them an increasingly popular choice for many. They offer a combination of convenience, effectiveness, and gentleness that traditional floss sometimes lacks. As always, it’s important to consult with your dentist to determine the best flossing method for your individual needs.</p><p>Happy flossing! 💧🦷</p><img src=/posts/2024/10/get-cleaner-teeth-with-water-flosser/bitmoji-toothbrush-floss_hu_c855ad838acb725.png alt="Bitmoji standing next to toothbrush and floss" loading=lazy></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
