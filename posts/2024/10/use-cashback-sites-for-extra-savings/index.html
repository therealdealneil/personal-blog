With online shopping becoming more ubiquitous, the quest for savings is more relevant than ever. Previously, I discussed how you can find easy coupon codes with <a href=/posts/2024/10/use-retailmenot-to-save-big>RetailMeNot</a>. But one of the most effective ways to save money while shopping online is through cashback sites like Rakuten. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with how these platforms work, buckle up. You’re about to find out how you can make every purchase count and put some cash back into your pocket.</p><h3 id=how-cashback-sites-work>How Cashback Sites Work</h3><p>Cashback websites partner with thousands of online retailers, from major giants to niche boutiques, to offer a percentage of your purchase back in the form of cash. Essentially, when you shop through these sites, they earn a commission from the retailer, and then share a portion of that commission with you. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation—you get your favorite products, and some extra cash back.</p><h3 id=why-rakuten>Why Rakuten?</h3><p><a href=https://www.rakuten.com/>Rakuten</a> used to go by the name eBates (which was a much better name, in my opinion!). It&rsquo;s one of the most well-known and user-friendly cashback sites out there. It boasts partnerships with over 2,500 stores, including big names like Amazon, Walmart, and Macy&rsquo;s. The cashback percentages vary depending on the retailer and current promotions, but you can often find deals ranging from 1% to 10%, and occasionally even higher.</p><img src=/posts/2024/10/use-cashback-sites-for-extra-savings/rakuten_hu15117583839085237450.png alt="Screenshot of Rakuten showing multiple stores with cashback" loading=lazy><h3 id=easy-installation-with-browser-extensions>Easy Installation with Browser Extensions</h3><p>One of the best features of Rakuten is its <a href=https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rakuten-get-cash-back-for/chhjbpecpncaggjpdakmflnfcopglcmi>browser extension</a>, which makes enabling cashback as easy as clicking a button. Here’s how you can set it up:</p><ol><li><strong>Install the Extension</strong>: Head to the <a href=https://chromewebstore.google.com/>Chrome Web Store</a> (or your browser’s equivalent) and search for the Rakuten extension. It’s free to install.</li><li><strong>Activate Cashback</strong>: Once installed, the extension will notify you whenever you visit a partner store, prompting you to activate cashback. No need to remember to visit Rakuten&rsquo;s site before shopping.</li><li><strong>Shop as Usual</strong>: With the cashback activated, just shop as you normally would. Rakuten tracks your purchase and credits your account with the cashback percentage.</li><li><strong>Get Paid</strong>: Rakuten sends out payments every quarter via PayPal or check, as long as you’ve accumulated $5.01 or more in cashback.</li></ol><h3 id=why-you-should-use-rakuten>Why You Should Use Rakuten</h3><p>Not only is Rakuten incredibly easy to use, but it also offers a plethora of additional features to enhance your shopping experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Coupons and Promo Codes</strong>: Rakuten often has exclusive coupons and promo codes that you can stack on top of cashback offers, maximizing your savings.</li><li><strong>Cashback on Travel</strong>: Beyond everyday shopping, Rakuten also offers cashback on travel bookings, including flights, hotels, and car rentals.</li><li><strong>Double Cashback Events</strong>: Periodically, Rakuten runs special promotions where cashback rates are doubled at select stores. Keep an eye out for these events to boost your savings even further.</li></ul><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>If you’re someone who loves finding ways to save while shopping online, Rakuten is a no-brainer. With its wide range of partnered stores, easy-to-use browser extension, and regular cashback payouts, it’s a seamless way to stretch your dollar further. So why not give it a try and see how much you can save on your next online shopping spree?</p><p>Happy shopping and happy saving!</p><img src=/posts/2024/10/use-cashback-sites-for-extra-savings/bitmoji-stealing-money_hu15899285378563307179.png alt="Bitmoji with a bag of stolen money" loading=lazy></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
