My first robot vacuum purchase in 2017 was one of those. At that time, I decided to take a deep dive into robot vacuums. After many years of hearing about them, I felt the time was right and smarts in the technology were ready for wide adoption. After pouring into my research, I purchased a Xiaomi Mi Vacuum. This was an international Chinese vacuum which made me a little hesitant, but the buzz behind it was incredible. Turned out, it was well deserved.</p><p>The robot would start up and immediately start mapping out my home. It would then systematically start running itself across every nook and cranny of my home. Once done, it would park itself back into its charging dock. To top it off, the app would show a map of your home with tracks indicating exactly where the robot went.</p><img src=/posts/2024/10/get-a-roborock-vacuum/bitmoji-mind-blown_hu8800271768981752043.png alt="Bitmoji showing mind blown" loading=lazy><p>Each day at it&rsquo;s scheduled time, it went about its business scooping up all kinds of dust, crumbs and more from my floors. With two toddlers in house, you can imagine how invaluable this was. What amazed me most was how reliable it was and how smart its technology was. Unlike vacuums from years earlier, this one was systematic and would map out your home and ensure maximum coverage. Other vacuums would just go around randomly and you&rsquo;d get lucky if it actually covered your floors.</p><p>Fast-forward to today and the company behind my Xiaomi Mi vacuum decided to enter the global market under the <a href=https://us.roborock.com/>Roborock</a> brand. I purchased a newer model in 2022 and it continues to dazzle me. I strongly recommend these vacuums for everyone.</p><p><a href=https://us.roborock.com/><img src=/posts/2024/10/get-a-roborock-vacuum/roborock-brand-image_hu2021753531228803003.jpg alt="Roborock showroom" loading=lazy></a></p><h3 id=why-invest-in-a-robot-vacuum>Why Invest in a Robot Vacuum?</h3><p><strong>Time-Saver Extraordinaire</strong>: Imagine reclaiming the hours spent vacuuming.

From smart mapping and navigation to powerful suction and automatic dirt disposal, these features offer a level of cleaning precision and convenience that&rsquo;s hard to match.</p><p><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Setting up a robot vacuum is often as simple as plugging it in, connecting it to your Wi-Fi, and pressing a button. Some models can even be controlled via smartphone apps, allowing you to start a cleaning session remotely.</p><h3 id=roborock-superior-technology-at-a-reasonable-price>Roborock: Superior Technology at a Reasonable Price</h3><p>When it comes to robot vacuums, <a href=https://us.roborock.com/><strong>Roborock</strong></a> is a brand that consistently delivers high-quality performance without breaking the bank.

Their ability to switch from carpets to hard floors seamlessly is a standout feature.</p><p><strong>Multi-Functionality</strong>: Many Roborock models offer both vacuuming and mopping capabilities, providing a comprehensive cleaning solution in one device. This dual functionality adds incredible value, especially for homes with a mix of floor types.</p><p><strong>Smart Features</strong>: Roborock’s integration with smart home systems like Alexa and Google Assistant allows for voice-controlled cleaning sessions. Plus, their user-friendly app lets you set schedules, define no-go zones, and monitor cleaning progress from anywhere.</p><p>My current vacuum is the Roborock S7 which is previous generation and has been superceded by the <a href=https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s8>Roborock S8</a>. This is the model I recommend for most folks. If you have a higher budget and want to invest in a more advanced model, you could take a look, but I generally find that the base model does just fine.</p><h3 id=the-return-on-value>The Return on Value</h3><p>Investing in a robot vacuum, particularly a Roborock, can bring significant returns on value:</p><p><strong>Cost-Efficiency</strong>: Compared to the ongoing costs of hiring cleaning services, a one-time investment in a Roborock vacuum saves money in the long run. Its durability and reliability ensure you get the most bang for your buck.</p><p><strong>Increased Productivity</strong>: By offloading the cleaning chore to a robot vacuum, you gain extra time to be productive in other areas of your life. Whether it&rsquo;s pursuing hobbies or spending quality time with loved ones, the benefits are manifold.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Home Environment</strong>: A cleaner home contributes to better air quality and a healthier living environment. Regular cleaning by a robot vacuum reduces allergens and dust, creating a more comfortable space for everyone.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Robot vacuums are more than just a convenience—they’re a smart investment that offers tangible benefits in terms of time savings, cleanliness, and overall quality of life. <a href=https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s8>Roborock</a>, with its superior technology and reasonable pricing, stands out as a top recommendation.
