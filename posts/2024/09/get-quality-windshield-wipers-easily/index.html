During my recent state vehicle inspection, they flagged my windshield wipers as needing replacement. They wouldn’t pass my inspection until I provided proof that it was replaced, or let them replace it. Of course, it’s a common tactic to make easy money. Windshield wipers are ridiculously easy to replace and you should always do it yourself.
One thing holding me back in the past was the cost. I couldn’t justify replacing windshield wipers every year when they ran up to $30 for a pair. Or pay less for a budget pair which wouldn’t take long to start streaking on your windshields."><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/get-quality-windshield-wipers-easily/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Neil Gandhi"><meta property="og:title" content="Replace Your Windshield Wipers Without Breaking The Bank"><meta property="og:description" content="\

In the results were <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097XZNW5V?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1">&ldquo;OEM Quality&rdquo; windshield wipers</a> for less than $10 for a pair. My skepticism flared up. Would they really be that good? But for half the price of any name brand pair, I figured it was worth the shot.</p><p>Wow! These windshield wipers knocked it out of the park. They were easy to install, looked good, and most importantly worked as good if not better than any other pair I had before. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZN0SU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1">My previous pair</a> was annoying to install and looked flimsy - but it was a budget brand. The new pair was half the price and twice the quality.</p><h3 id=finding-a-pair-on-amazon>Finding a Pair on Amazon</h3><p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/your-garage/?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=sv_auto_1">Your Garage</a> to let you enter your car details.

Obviously, focus on results with 4+ star reviews and low prices.</p><h3 id=replace-wipers-frequently>Replace Wipers Frequently</h3><p>With prices this low, it makes it economical to replace windshield wipers frequently. It&rsquo;s recommended to replace them every 6-12 months. I prefer replacing it once a year and will enter this as a service reminder in my <a href=https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/use-drivvo-car-manager/>Drivvo</a> app.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>I&rsquo;m not an Amazon Affiliate or getting paid for these reviews. It was a pleasant surprise that I was overspending for years on something and I want to share this with my audience so they can benefit as well!</p><img src=/posts/2024/09/get-quality-windshield-wipers-easily/driving-bitmoji_hu13916653152341059551.png alt="Driving Bitmoji" loading=lazy></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
