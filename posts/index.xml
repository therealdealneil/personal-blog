&lt;p>During my recent state vehicle inspection, they flagged my windshield wipers as needing replacement. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass my inspection until I provided proof that it was replaced, or let them replace it. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a common tactic to make easy money. Windshield wipers are ridiculously easy to replace and you should always do it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing holding me back in the past was the cost. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify replacing windshield wipers every year when they ran up to $30 for a pair. Or pay less for a budget pair which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long to start streaking on your windshields.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Securing ASP .NET Core Apps Made Easy</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/secure-headers-asp-net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 09:32:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/secure-headers-asp-net/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;p>Whether you like it or not, there are best practices for security that web applications need to follow. ðŸ‘‹ Today, I want to chat about a nifty little library that can make your ASP.NET Core applications more secure with minimal effort. Say hello to &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-security-headers">The Problem: Security Headers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been working with web applications for a while, you know that security is a big deal. One common way to enhance security is by adding security headers to your HTTP responses. These headers can help protect against a variety of attacks, like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. However, manually configuring these headers can be a bit of a hassle. You have to remember which headers to add, what values to set, and ensure they&amp;rsquo;re applied consistently across your app.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Home Repairs Easily with Google Sheets</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/track-home-repairs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 12:01:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/track-home-repairs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a homeowner and as your home ages, repairs will become common. Often, you need to go back to see when you did a repair or what kind of warranty the repair had. Keeping track of home repairs and improvements can be a daunting task, but using a &lt;a href="https://sheets.google.com">Google Sheets&lt;/a> spreadsheet can make it much easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method allows you to maintain a detailed history of all the work done on your home, including information about contractors, dates, costs, and warranties. As a homeowner, this will come in handy when inevitably you need to look at what kind of warranty you had on a part or which contractor you used before. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up and the benefits it offers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brighten Up Your TV Experience with LED Light Strips</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/led-light-strip-tv/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 19:01:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/led-light-strip-tv/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

Why Not a Metarepo!</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/use-git-metarepo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 12:17:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/use-git-metarepo/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the software development world, there&amp;rsquo;s always a debate about whether to use monorepos or multi-repos.

&lt;h3 id="whats-a-metarepo">What&amp;rsquo;s a Metarepo?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A metarepo, or meta-repository, is like a master repo that holds references to other repos. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain the actual code but acts as a central hub. This way, you can manage multiple repos as if they were one, striking a balance between monorepo and multi-repo setups.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use Drivvo to Maintain Your Car</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/use-drivvo-car-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 18:56:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/use-drivvo-car-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey there, fellow productivity enthusiasts!
