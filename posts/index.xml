While traditional floss has been a staple in dental care for decades, water flossers are gaining popularity as a modern alternative. A few years ago I made a switch to water flossers and I was genuinely surprised at much it improved my teeth. I don&amp;rsquo;t say that in jest either. My dental cleaning appointments became much faster and I noticed less time spent cleaning out plaque and tartar. The hygenists also noticed an improvement in my teeth and commented on how clean they are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Make VS Code Smarter with GitLens!</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-gitlens-to-boost-productivity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-gitlens-to-boost-productivity/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the realm of software development, understanding the history of your codebase is paramount.

&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, managing passwords can be a daunting task. With the increasing number of online accounts, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to maintain strong, unique passwords for each one. Yet, many people avoid using password managers for no good reason, often relying on weak, easily guessable passwords or reusing the same password across multiple sites. This practice is a recipe for disaster, leading to potential identity theft and account breaches. Amongst the alternatives, I recommend most people adopt &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden&lt;/a> as their password manager of choice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boost Browser Productivity with CrxMouse for Chrome</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-crxmouse-gestures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/10/use-crxmouse-gestures/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced development environment, ensuring the stability and reliability of your applications is paramount.

&lt;p>In my early engineering career, I used email to capture exceptions from our applications. Obviously, it became overwhelming and inefficient quickly! After some time, I adopted dedicated monitoring tools like &lt;a href="https://sentry.io/">&lt;strong>Sentry&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> which brought immediate and significant productivity benefits for myself and my teams.

&lt;p>During my recent state vehicle inspection, they flagged my windshield wipers as needing replacement. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass my inspection until I provided proof that it was replaced, or let them replace it. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a common tactic to make easy money. Windshield wipers are ridiculously easy to replace and you should always do it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing holding me back in the past was the cost. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify replacing windshield wipers every year when they ran up to $30 for a pair.

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been working with web applications for a while, you know that security is a big deal.

However, manually configuring these headers can be a bit of a hassle. You have to remember which headers to add, what values to set, and ensure they&amp;rsquo;re applied consistently across your app.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Track Home Repairs Easily with Google Sheets</title><link>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/track-home-repairs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 12:01:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.realdealneil.com/posts/2024/09/track-home-repairs/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/p>
